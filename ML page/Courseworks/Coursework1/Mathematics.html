<p class="b">Mathematics is the foundation knowledge needed in most sector or field anyone wants to branch into,
Mathematics consists of many things that are used in the real world, where ever you go you will always
see numbers, shapes, probabilities and much more. Having a sustainable and a good foundation knowledge of
Mathematics will enchance your overall skill in many different areas hence the reason for most fields and professions
 Mathematics is a neccessity. Within this website you will be able to absorb knowledge that could be useful within your
profession or field you inspire to be in or already in.</p>

<h2>Operators</h2>



<div id="add" style="display:inline-block;"><h3>Addition</h3>
  <p class="op">The basic principle of maths consists of Addition, which is adding two or more numbers together.
  For example, if we have three apples and bought two more we're going to add it to what we already have,
so three plus two is five apples.</p>
</div>

<div id="sub" style="display:inline-block;"><h3>Subtraction</h3><p class="op">The basic principle of maths consists of su,
which is minusing two or more numbers together.
For example, if we have three apples and sold two  we're going to subtract it to what we already have,
so three minus two is one apple.</p></div>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<div id="mul" style="display:inline-block;"><h3>Multiplication</h3>
  <p class="op">The basic principle of maths consists of Multiplication, an example of this would be if we were
    given two boxes of three apples in each box, we would multiply three by three to get the total apples.</p>
</div>

<div id="div" style="display:inline-block;"><h3>Division</h3><p class="op">The basic principle of maths consists of division,
  an example of this would be if we had one-hundred apples and we needed to put them in boxes of five apples, the amount of boxes we need
  would be one-hundred divided by five, which is twenty.</p></div>

              <li>
                <p>Model building involves creating Regression Lines and predicting.

                    Population is everyone, a sample is a chosen amount of people from a population. If
                    you're measuring the sample it would be called a statistics, otherwise measuring the population would
                    be called a parameter.</p>

        My personal doctrine is to aim to complete everything to the best of my
         abilities, and my capabilities of being punctual, trustworthy, and organised
          also allows me to work efficiently under pressure. Furthermore, I’m motivated
           and aim to participate in challenging tasks and I have a resilient mindset
            seeking new experiences in order to further develop my skills as well as
             prepare for future challenges, hence my reason for doing Computer science
             at City, University of London. With my acceptable knowledge of Computer science
             I seek to develop it further pushing through my limits in order to be the best
             version of Myself.</p>

            <li><p>I took part in a virtual work experience, we worked in groups in order
             to complete a presentation about vaccines, we had to research about the
              covid-19 vaccine and inform the public.</p>

               <li><p>We then had to present it to many
               students, Industry owners and George Egorov the CFO; he gave us feedback,
                in which he said he found it to be perfect. This has led to a boost to my
                 teamwork skills, communication, and research skills which are essential
                  skills that can be used through many different fields.

        <p>I enjoy learning different Computer Science languages and what projects I could create with them,
        I like to test what I have learnt from the languages hence why I do random projects. I often play football, chess and swimming
        with friends. I enjoy spending time with friends and family but during my own time I occassionaly read books and teach my self languages
        such as Spanish.</p>

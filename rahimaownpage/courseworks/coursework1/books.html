<h2><i>"A Thousand Splendid Suns"</i> by Khaled Hosseini</h2>

<div id="boxshadow">
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">This book is an amazing, breathtaking, beautiful book. It is about two women from Afghanistan, Mariam and Laila. and it explores the following themes:
  war, the taliban, motherhood, abuse, relationships, sisterhood, and friendships. The book compels you very quickly, simply due to to the inherent nature of the narrative of the story.
  It is a very tragic book, where happiness for the characters is sparse, but it is so incredibly well written you continue to read it</p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Mariam is born an illegitimate child. She suffers from this stigma and abuse throughout her forced marriage to shoemaker, Rasheed.
    A generation later, Laila's uprbringing is comparatively priviledged, until their lives intersect and Laila is forced to accept a marriage proposal, from Rasheed.

<h2><i>"Natives"</i> by Akala</h2>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36352480-natives?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=OgjFxHJOt3&rank=2"> <!--https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_links_image-->

<br></br>
<div id="boxshadow">
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">This book is part autobiographical. It seamlessly provides an honest analysis of race and class within modern British society
     and how they intersect and impact one another. I took history throughout my secondary-sixth form experience and it was all focused on how Britain was successful.
   However, reading this shows the true history of Britain and how its history impacts us today. The way Akala writes is what draws the reader in. It is not complex, in fact it
 is highly accessible and this is important when discussing such issues.  </p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Akala looks at how racism and class permeates various social issues such as education, policing and politics.

<h2><i>"Atomic Habits"</i> by James Clear</h2>

<br></br>
<div id="boxshadow">
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> This book is a self help book about how to build good habits and break bad habits. It provides so much tangible advice that anyone can utilise in their day-to-day lives
 the fact that a lot of studies and real world examples are used to support the advice is far more convincing than other self help books</p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> All habits are based on a four step pattern which consists of cue, craving, response and award. The book dives further
    into the details of these steps.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:15px;">Places abroad</h1>
<div id="boxshadow">
<p><ul><br><u>Bangladesh:</u></br>
We most commonly visit Bangladesh as that is where my parents are from. We have many relatives in Bangladesh and therefore it is a lot more conveninet for us, but it also feels like home.
<br></br>

<br><u>France:</u></br>
I stayed with a friend who had a studio flat in the middle of Paris. My favourite part of staying was fresh croissants from the bakery every morning.
<br><br>

<br><u>Finland:</u></br>
This is my favourite country to visit. We had our own house that we rented out. It was very close to the ocean and we had a boat that we could use to commute.
<br></br>

<br><u>Italy:</u></br>
I stayed in Rome with my family friends. We ate a lot of pizza and visited monuments.
<br></br>

<br><u>Dubai:</u></br>
Here we went on lots of boat rides and visited family.
<br></br>

<br><u>Saudi Arabia:</u></br>
I was very young when I visted with my family, so my memory of it is not as strong. But we went as part of a holy pilgrimage.
<br></br>

<br><u>Qatar:</u></br>
This was only a brief stay due to a delayed flight but we spent two days exploring the area. </p>

<div id="boxshadow">
<ul><u><br>Cardiff:</br></u>
this is our most commonly visited place in the UK, as we have lots of family there.<br>
<br></br>

<br><u>Birmingham:</u></br>
I went to Birmingham with my sisters to stay with our auntie for a week. We visited various places and spent time with cousins.<br>
<br></br>

<br><u>Cambridge:</u></br>
I visted the University of Cambridge as part of a trip in secondary. This visit was due to a science project on different materials that I carried out with fellow students. <br>
<br></br>

<br><u>Oxford:</u></br>
This was also another trip with school where I visited Oxford university, due to a science project.<br>
<br></br>

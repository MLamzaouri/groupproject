  <h4>Interests</h4>
  <p> Because I am naturally creative I enjoy reading fantasy novels. However, I also like to read educational books and websites which further my knowledge and keep it up to date. My interest in computer science is demonstrated through my EPQ titled: ‘Exploiting vulnerability: The need for cyber-awareness in young and elderly digital technology users’. I learned from academic studies of criminal cases as well as gathering primary evidence from my peers. I was able to hone my public speaking skills, boost my confidence, as well as improving my ability to conduct independent research. As part of my weekly activities, I attend a local gym where I engage in a variety of physical exercises as well as cycling. This helps me to maintain a healthy body and agile mind.</p>
